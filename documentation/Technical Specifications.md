This data flow diagram shows how user input is processed through the system, from the user interface through file management, core processing, and collaboration services. It also illustrates the interaction with both local and cloud storage, as well as the integration of add-ins and version control.

The architecture described in this section is designed to support the cross-platform nature of Microsoft Word (Windows, macOS, and web-based versions) while maintaining consistency and performance across all platforms. The use of a shared core engine written in C++ allows for maximum performance and code reuse, while platform-specific languages (C# for Windows, Swift for macOS, and TypeScript/JavaScript for web) are used to create native user interfaces and platform-specific integrations.

# SYSTEM DESIGN

## PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

Microsoft Word will be developed using a combination of programming languages, each chosen for its specific strengths and suitability for different components of the application. The following table outlines the primary languages to be used and their justifications:

| Language | Purpose | Justification |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| C++ | Core engine, performance-critical components | High performance, low-level control, cross-platform compatibility |
| C# | Windows desktop application, business logic | Strong integration with Windows APIs, productivity, type safety |
| Swift | macOS desktop application | Native macOS development, performance, modern language features |
| TypeScript | Web-based version, cross-platform scripting | Type safety, excellent tooling, wide browser support |
| JavaScript | Web-based version (client-side), add-ins | Universal browser support, rich ecosystem |
| Python | Automation scripts, tooling | Rapid development, extensive libraries for text processing |
| SQL | Database queries and management | Industry standard for relational database operations |

## DATABASE DESIGN

Microsoft Word primarily uses file-based storage for documents, but it also requires a database for managing user preferences, document metadata, and collaboration features. We will use a combination of relational and NoSQL databases to meet different requirements:

1. Relational Database (SQL Server for Windows, SQLite for local storage):

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER ||--o{ DOCUMENT : creates
    USER ||--o{ PREFERENCE : has
    DOCUMENT ||--o{ VERSION : has
    DOCUMENT ||--o{ COMMENT : contains
    DOCUMENT {
        string id PK
        string title
        datetime created_at
        datetime modified_at
        string creator_id FK
    }
    USER {
        string id PK
        string name
        string email
        string account_type
    }
    PREFERENCE {
        string id PK
        string user_id FK
        string key
        string value
    }
    VERSION {
        string id PK
        string document_id FK
        datetime created_at
        string creator_id FK
    }
    COMMENT {
        string id PK
        string document_id FK
        string user_id FK
        string content
        datetime created_at
    }
```

2. NoSQL Database (Azure Cosmos DB):
   - Used for storing document content and structure
   - Flexible schema to accommodate various document elements
   - High-performance read/write operations for real-time collaboration

## API DESIGN

Microsoft Word will implement a RESTful API for communication between the client applications and the backend services. The API will follow OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications for clear documentation and easy integration.

Key API endpoints:

1. Document Management:
   - GET /documents: Retrieve user's documents
   - POST /documents: Create a new document
   - GET /documents/{id}: Retrieve a specific document
   - PUT /documents/{id}: Update a document
   - DELETE /documents/{id}: Delete a document

2. Collaboration:
   - POST /documents/{id}/share: Share a document
   - GET /documents/{id}/comments: Retrieve comments for a document
   - POST /documents/{id}/comments: Add a comment to a document

3. Version Control:
   - GET /documents/{id}/versions: Retrieve version history
   - POST /documents/{id}/versions: Create a new version
   - PUT /documents/{id}/versions/{versionId}: Restore a specific version

4. User Management:
   - POST /users: Create a new user
   - GET /users/{id}: Retrieve user information
   - PUT /users/{id}: Update user information

5. Preferences:
   - GET /users/{id}/preferences: Retrieve user preferences
   - PUT /users/{id}/preferences: Update user preferences

Authentication will be handled using OAuth 2.0, with JWT tokens for secure API access.

## USER INTERFACE DESIGN

The user interface for Microsoft Word will be designed to be intuitive, efficient, and consistent across all platforms (Windows, macOS, and web). The UI will follow Microsoft's Fluent Design System principles.

Key UI components:

1. Ribbon Interface:
   - Tabbed interface for organizing features
   - Customizable Quick Access Toolbar

2. Document Editing Area:
   - WYSIWYG editing interface
   - Ruler and guidelines for precise layout control

3. Sidebar Panels:
   - Context-sensitive panels for additional functionality (e.g., styles, navigation)

4. Status Bar:
   - Document information and quick access to view settings

5. Dialog Boxes:
   - Modal windows for advanced settings and operations

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Main Window] --> B[Ribbon Interface]
    A --> C[Document Editing Area]
    A --> D[Sidebar Panels]
    A --> E[Status Bar]
    B --> F[Home Tab]
    B --> G[Insert Tab]
    B --> H[Layout Tab]
    B --> I[References Tab]
    B --> J[Review Tab]
    B --> K[View Tab]
    C --> L[Text Area]
    C --> M[Ruler]
    D --> N[Styles Panel]
    D --> O[Navigation Panel]
    D --> P[Review Panel]
```

Accessibility Considerations:
- High contrast themes
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Customizable font sizes and color schemes

Responsive Design:
- Adaptive layout for different screen sizes
- Touch-friendly interface for mobile devices
- Consistent core functionality across platforms

The user interface will be implemented using platform-specific technologies:
- Windows: WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) with XAML
- macOS: AppKit and SwiftUI
- Web: React.js with TypeScript for component-based UI development

This system design aligns with the previously mentioned technology choices, including the use of C++ for the core engine, C# and Swift for desktop applications, and TypeScript/JavaScript for the web-based version. The database design supports both local and cloud-based storage requirements, while the API design facilitates communication between different components of the system and enables integration with external services.
